## Pedestrian Detection
We plan to use [Caltech Pedestrian Dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/index.html)
with [new annotations](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/index.html),
[CityPersons](https://bitbucket.org/shanshanzhang/citypersons) (a part of [CityScapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)) and 
[KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=2d) for benchmarking.

Besides, we found a more practical dataset [CUHK-SYSU Person Search Dataset](https://github.com/Dataset-VIPL-CAS/PSDBC).
We will also use this dataset for evaluation.

If you know some other good datasets, please inform us.
